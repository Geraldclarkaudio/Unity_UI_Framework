# Unity_UI_Framework
This is the GDHQ framework project for Unity's UI system. 

The main purpose of this project is to delve into Unity's UI system and build a mobile game with it while taking mobile game performance into consideration using addressables. 

I intend to release this game on the Google Play store when it is complete.
